In 6th grade, I made this game for a school project. I'm still salty over not winning the technology award at the end of the year.

Note: The code for this game is very very bad! I made it in 6th grade. My only real previous programming experience was in writing Batch scripts, because our IT department forgot to block them from running on school computers. Even though I plan on refactoring the code to be less horrible, I'll have to preserve some of the bad code in order to keep parity with the original "game mechanics". This repository is pretty much only here for the benefit of my friends who remember the game, and want to mess around with it.
